Terminal game move function
<br><br>
In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
<br><br>
Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
<br>
Example:
<br><br>
move(3, 6) should equal 15
